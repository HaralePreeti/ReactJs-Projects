                <p>“When you are travelling by bus, it is always difficult to decide whether you should sit in a seat by
             the window, a seat on the aisle, or a seat in the middle. If you take an aisle seat, you have the 
             advantage of being able to stretch your legs whenever you like, but you have the disadvantage of 
             people walking by you and they can accidentally step on your toes or spill something on your clothing.
             <br></br>
             <br></br>
             If you take a window seat, you have the advantage of getting a clear view of the scenery,
              but you have the disadvantage of watching insects die as they hit the glass.If you take a
               middle seat, you have neither of these advantages, and you have the added disadvantage of
                people leaning all over you when they fall asleep. You can see at once why you should
                 always arrange to hire a limousine or rent a mule rather than take the bus to your 
                 destination.”</p>
